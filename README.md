here i have the code for esp32 cam module after going through a lot of codes 
finally i made my own code through ai which works by turning inbuilt hotspot on
and when u connect to the hotspot and open browser and enter the ip adress u can get the live stream of the camera 
im further developing this to add more functionalaties
